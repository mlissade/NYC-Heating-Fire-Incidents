                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">If you have ever had the Citizen app downloaded on your smart phone, then you
                    know how many alerts you receive in a day living in New York City (NYC).</h5>

                <p class="w3-text-grey">Citizen is a mobile app that sends real-time safety alerts based on the location
                    of its user. In my experience having the app, I have seen many notifications of fires caused by
                    heaters during the winter. On the morning of January 9th, 2022, I received a notification of an
                    accidental blaze that took the lives of 17 people from the choking smoke of a 19-story residential
                    building in the Bronx. This fire was the third deadliest the United States (US) has seen in more
                    than four decades. A malfunctioning space heater was the cause of the fatal blaze. The second
                    leading cause of home fires and home fire injuries is heating. It is also the third leading cause of
                    home fire deaths. In a 2017 housing survey, nearly 20% of households in the Bronx utilize a
                    secondary source of heat in addition to their primary source. At 20%, the Bronx currently has the
                    highest rate among all the boroughs.</p>

                <h1>About the Project</h1>
                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This project addresses heating fire incidents throughout the NYC
                    boroughs during the cold weather seasons.</h5>

                <p class="w3-text-grey">How many complaints does the Department of Housing
                    Preservation and Development (HPD) get about heat per season? Are there more residential heating
                    fires during the colder months? Are more of these fires in low-income areas? This project would
                    highlight the importance to NYC residents about knowing their rights to proper heating during the
                    cold weather seasons and holding their landlords accountable for making sure it is provided. It
                    would also give insights to the HPD as to how imperative it is for them to investigate buildings
                    that make complaints of poor heating. Most importantly, this urges lawmakers and fire marshals to
                    create and enforce regulations that could prevent incidents like the January 2022 Bronx fire from
                    happening again.</p>
